sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Because when testing, bubble gets a pair of numbers to sort it, which means if the list is already-
sorted, it wont have to swap any number and it will declare the array sorted faster than Sort3, but not than Sort2.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Because when testing the toughest ones like random50000 (big arrays), you can see that it's significantly faster than sort1 and sort3;

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: In a few cases it's faster than Sort1, but not than Sort2.
